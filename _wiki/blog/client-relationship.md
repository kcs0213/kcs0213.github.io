> "Covering clients is a learned skill; it is not an innate skill" 

> (1) Learn from someone who is really good. Do everything you can to learn from him. In exchange, try to help him whatever you can (e.g: carrying his bags).

> (Find someone who is really good and learn from that person. Put my ego aside. Do everything you can to learn from him. In exchange, do everything to help him (carry his bags). Find someone who is really good and flatter the person.)

> (2) Become a strategic advisor - i.e. advise the client holistically. Do a great job in the task that your client assign you to do, but also use the oppportunity to engage with the client in other things. Advise the client holistically. Take the opportunity to help the client in other ways. If you do a good job, the client will trust you advice him in anything. Do a great job in the task but use the opportunity with the client to engage in other things.

> (3) Listen and ask open ended question. The more you listen, the better the client feel and the more you learn.

> (4) Be creative. When your client proposes something, you can say no. But, try to come out something else. It shows to the client that you are trying.

> (5) Put the client first. It is achieved in two ways. First, be prepared to give advice that is not in your interest. In the long run, the client will trust you more. Second, work really hard for the client. The client will believe that you are there for him.

> (6) Be upbeat. Don’t share the negative aspects of your life to your client. People want to be around upbeat people.

> (7) Take classes in the law and business. Two reasons. First, you will learn to understand business and how corporations function. Second, you will be able to grasp the legal and business jargons.
