> All the times that I worked hard because I believed
> That life could have meanin' through things I've achieved
> Well, You knew I was lookin' for You
> Every time I thought romance might fill up the hole
> That incomplete feelin' still ached in my soul
> Oh, You knew I was lookin' for You
> 
> Down a hundred highways of empty pursuit
> And a thousand foolish things I went through
> Didn't know it back then but now I do
> I was lookin' for You, I was lookin' for You
>
> When I couldn't find comfort in the things I could buy
> When the party was over and the bottle was dry
> Oh, You knew I was lookin' for You
> Oh, and I went searchin'

> Down a hundred highways of empty pursuit
> And a thousand foolish things I went through
> Didn't know it back then but now I do
>I was lookin' for You, I was lookin' for You

> Through the canyons and the heartaches
> And the valleys of pain
> Down those pathways full of pleasure
> And those dead end roads of shame
> Oh, I couldn't name the hunger
> That I tried to satisfy

> Down a hundred highways of empty pursuit
> And a thousand foolish things I went through
> In a moment I looked up from down on my knees
> And I cried out to Heaven, I could finally see
> Jesus, Jesus, I know it's true
> All of my life I was lookin' for You
